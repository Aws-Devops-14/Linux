User Management:-
Super User(Root User):-User is the moast powerful User. HE is the Administater. Ex:-Root, Home Directory:-/root, Shell:-/bash/bin
System User:-Users created by the Softwares and Applications.Created for services or background processes (like mysql, www-data) Ex:-ftp/ssh/apache, Home Directory:-/var/ftp, Shell:-/sbin/nologin
Normal User:-Normal Users are the Users created by the Root User. Ex:-visitor,ec2-User, Home Directory:-/home/username, Shell:-/bash/bin
User:-	A person or process that uses the system (e.g., root, john, ubuntu)
Group:- A collection of users with similar permissions

User Creation:-
Whenevr a user is created in Linux, These things happen by default
1.A home directory is created (/home/username)
2.A UniquemID(UID) and GroupID(GID) are given to user
3.An entry in /etc/passwd

Syntax for creating user in Linux:
--> useradd <option> <username>
1.-u user id
2.-G Secondary group id
3.-g Primary group id
4.-d home directory
5.-c Comment
6.-s Shell
7.init 6 --> is restart the system
8.sudo useradd -m john :- here create a john User in a root User

Software Managenment:-
yum is the primary tool for getting,updating,installing,querying and managing software packages in Linux.
We can use this yum in Red-hat linux distribution only.
1.yum install <package name>
2.yum remove <package name>
3.yum update <package name>
4.yum info <package name>
5.yum list available
6.yum list installed
butttttttttttttttttt

Linux distribution of Ubuntu in use

1.sudo apt install package
2.sudo apt remove package
3.sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
4.apt list
5.apt-cache policy
6.wget--web get download files from the internet

System Information:-
1.history-->Shows all commands executed by user
2.free-->Free memory of a server
3.cat /prc/meminfo-->memory information
4.cat /prc/cpuinfo-->Cpu Information
5.uanme -a-->Shows System & kernel info (Unix name)
6.du-->Show directoryspace usage
7.whereis--> Show possible location of app
8.which-->Show which app will be run by default 

File Types:-
1.b-->Block File(hard disk, floppy disk)
2.d-->Directory
3.c-->Character File(Keyboard,Mouse)
4.l-->Link file
5.- -->Normal File

File Permissions:-
1.r -->Open the file
2.w -->Writr,edit,append,delete file
3.x -->To run a command/Shell Script
File permissions can be set on files/dir by using thses methods:-
1.Symbolic Method(ugo):-
#chmod [who] [+/-/=] [Permissions] file_name
#chmod u=rwx g=rw o=r file_name
#chmod ugo=rwx filename
---> in changingn of GID and USID
A unique home directory → /home/john
A private group → group john with GID = UID
✅ Makes file permissions simpler and safer (no conflict between users).
#sudo mkdir john
#sudo chown john:john /home/john:- means change owner from root to john
#groups--> shows which groups a user belongs to.(palemupendra adm dialout cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev users netdev libvirt docker)

2.Absolute Method:-
Instead Symbols using numbers
1.read=4
3.write=2
4.execute=1
#chmod--> Change Mode
#chown-->Change Owner
#chmod 764 <file_name>
#chmod 777 <filename>



File Permissions :-
Permissions Applied in 3 levels:-
1.Owner or User Level
2.Group Level
3.Other Level
Permissions Applied in 3 ways:-
1.r-->Read Only
2.w-->Write/edit/Append/Delete
3.x-->Execute/Run

file--> File command tells the what kind of file 

File and Directories:-
ls--> list of all files and directories
cat > filename-->create a file and allows to write 
cat filename--> shows content in a file only
cat >> filename--> append content to a previous file that we used file name in command
less--> shows page by page
more--> shows page by page in percent wise
head--> top 10 line in file
head -20 filename--> top 20 lines in a file
tail--> bottom 10 lines in a file
touch--> create 0 bytes of file
nano filename--> create file and allows to write edit               ctrl+o--enter--ctrl+x
vi filename--> create file and allows to write and edit---          esc--enter--:wq
mkdir -->make directory
rmdir-->remove directory
rm -rf-->forcefully remove directory
rm -rf *-->forcefully remove directory not to retake 
tree--> shows visually organized dir,folderas and files

Managing Files or Directories:-
cp-->Copy a file
cp file1 file2--> Copy from source file to destination file
cp file1 dir1-->copy file1 in dir1
mv-->Move a file
mv file1 file3-->means file1 in whole content move in file3, the file1 will disapear(Rename a file)
cd ..--> shift to previous working dir
pwd-->Present working dir
diff--> between two files in content diff will show

Grep Command:- Global Regular Expression Print
This command is used to pick up a particular expression from a file and print as a output
-->grep <patron> file_name
ls -l | grep <patromn>----> list of files in patron will be identify
ls -l | grep ^d-----search a d in list of all files

Sed Command:-
Stream Editor is used to a search a word and replace with another word required to be in the output
Note:-It will be only modify the output , but there will be no changes in original file
1.sed 's/old_text/new_text/' filename
2.sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' filename
3.sed -i 's/old_text/new_text/' filename

1.hostname-->List hostname of the server
2.ping google.com-->checks the network connection between your Linux system and the Google server.
3.wget-->web get-->download files, software, or packages from the internet directly into your Linux system using the command line.
4.ifconfig-->list IP address(es) of the server /////   ip addr show --> this command also use instead of config
5.telnet localhost 22-->specific port number is working or not.
6.curl-->download, upload, and communicate with web APIs
7.netstat -tulpn = Shows all running network services and their ports, along with which program is using each port.
----> Ping tests connectivity, Telnet tests specific port accessibility, Netstat shows active ports and services. <----

Port Numbers:-
Port numbers        service
  21                 FTP
  22                 SSH

3.service <name of the service> status
4.service <name of the service> reload
5.service <name of the service> restart
6.chkconfig --list---> To check the list of services available
7.chkconfig <service> on-->to make the service available after restart
8.chkconfig <service> off-->to make the service unavailable after restart

Archive & Compression:-
1.tar--->(tar archive) archieve files and folders in a single file without compression by default.
-c	Create archive
-v	Verbose (show files while archiving)
-f	Specify archive file name
-z Compress with gzip 
2.tar -cvf backup file22 file4 file55 file55.gz---> archieve these files in backup file
3.tar -cvf backup.tar backup---> archieve backup file in backup.tar file
4.tar -xvf backup---> Extract files from backup file
5. tar -xvf backup.tar---> extract file from backup.tar
6.gzip----> It compresses single files and creates a .gz file, helping save storage space and speed up file transfer.
7. gzip -c file55 > file55.gz---->This command compresses the file file55 and writes the compressed output to a new file named file55.gz, without deleting the original file.
