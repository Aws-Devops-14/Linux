Linux File System Structure is a Hierarical arrangement of directories in that organize files based on the purpose and function.
When a application installed in linux , the files are distributed across different directories based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

/bin → contains essential user command binaries.

/sbin → contains system administration binaries.

/etc → holds configuration files for applications and services.

/var → stores variable data such as logs, databases, and caches.

/usr → contains user-related programs and shared libraries.

/lib → includes shared library files needed by system programs.

/home → stores personal files for each user.
